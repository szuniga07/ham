Description: Conducts analyses for healthcare program evaluations or intervention 
 studies. Calculates regression analyses for standard ordinary least squares (OLD or 
 linear) or logistic models. And performs regression models used for causal modeling such 
 as differences-in-differences and interrupted time-series (ITS) models. Can provide 
 limited interpretations of model results and a ranking of variable importance from 
 the models. Performs propensity score models, top-coding of outcome variables in a model, 
 and can return new data with the newly formed variables and constructed variables used in 
 DID and ITS. Also performs Cronbach's alpha for various scale items (e.g., 5-point 
 Likert scale items from surveys).
