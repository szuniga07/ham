Description: Conducts analyses for healthcare program evaluations or intervention 
    studies. Calculates regression analyses for standard ordinary least squares 
    (OLS or linear) or logistic models. Performs regression models used for 
    causal modeling such as differences-in-differences (DID) and interrupted 
    time series (ITS) models. Provides limited interpretations of model 
    results and a ranking of variable importance in models. Performs 
    propensity score models, top-coding of model outcome variables, and 
    can return new data with the newly formed variables. Also performs Cronbach's 
    alpha for various scale items (e.g., survey questions). See Github URL for 
    examples in the README file. For more details on the statistical methods, see
